# FurnishAR # 

The purpose of the FurnishAR is to allow users to visualize furniture models in their own real-world environment. By using their phone or tablet camera, users can explore different furniture options and try them out in their own room. The app aims to reduce uncertainty, promote products, and enhance customer satisfaction.
